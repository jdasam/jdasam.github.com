I'm currently working as a researcher in SK T-Brain. I've finished my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Juhan Nam in [Music and Audio Computing (MAC) Lab](http://mac.kaist.ac.kr), Graduate School of Culture Technology [(GSCT)](http://ct.kaist.ac.kr), Korea Advanced Institue of Science and Technology [(KAIST)](http://www.kaist.ac.kr).

My research interest includes Creative AI, Expressive Performance Modeling, Automatic Music Transcription, Audio-to-Score Alignment, Music Visualization, Performance Analysis, Web Audio API, and Computational Musicology.

I love classical music a lot. This is the reason why my research interest is focused mainly on classical music. I've played the cello in KAIST Orchestra, and taken the lesson for orchestral conducting. I worked as an intern at Great Mountains Music Festival & School in 2012. I've traveled many foreign cities to watch concerts or operas, including Bayreuth, Salzburg, Luzern, Glyndebourne, Berlin, MÃ¼nchen, Madrid, London, Paris, Beijing, and Tokyo.
